Kamailio uses the SIP (session initialitation protocol) for session management.
This session management is implemented in three Call Session Control Functions(CSCF):
-the Proxy-CSCF
-the Interrogating-CSCF
-the Serving CSCF

These CSCFs interact with a number of different elements:
-the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) for authentication
-a Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) for network authorization and 
 policy control
-an Online Charging Server (OCS)
-an Offline Charging Server (OFCS) for charging

These interactions are facilitated by the Diameter protocol; Diameter is a flexible
protocol based on Attribute Value Pairs (AVP) - applications ranging from authentication,
authorization and charging can be built by extending the base protocol.
